# Proposal for Lathe and Evan's Quiz Creator

## Project Description and Motivation:
We will be writing a Quiz Creator; a program that does the grunt work of making a quiz for a user. The user will be asked what they want to name their quiz, what kind of questions they want to have (with the choices being multiple choice, True/False, numerical answer, and fill in the blank). This program will give the user a simple Q and A format to fill out what kind of quiz they want to create.
